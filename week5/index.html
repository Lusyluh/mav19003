            <h1>TESTING AND DEBUGGING</h1>

            <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warning</h2>
            <h3>What courses errors?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>System error - there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                    program is interacting.</li>
                <li>Programmer error - incorrect syntax or faulty logic or a typo</li>
                <li>User error - user enters incorrect data</li></ul>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal
                    with the error.
                    For example: trying to call amethod that does not exist resulting in a reference error.</p>

                <h3>Stack Traces</3>
                    <p>This is a sequence of functions or method calls that leadto the point where the error occured
                        Exceptions will also produce a stack trace.A stack trace will work backwards from the error to
                        identify the original
                        function or sequence that started the sequence</p>

                    <h3>Warnings</h3>
                    <p>A warning can occur is there's an error in the code that is not enough to cause the program to
                        crash.
                        The program will continue runnng after a warning.</p>
                    <p>Example is using a variable that is not declared
                        pi = 3.142;
                        JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable </p>

                    <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
                    <p>Strict mode consideres coding practices that were previously accepted as just being "poor style"
                        as actual errors</p>
                    <p>Writing code in strict mode can also help improve the program's clarity and speed, since it
                        follows conventions and will throw exceptions
                        if any sloppy code practices are used. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to
                        be written</p>
                    <p> 'use strict'; This must be added to the first line of code and will be picked by any JS engine
                        that uses strict mode.
                        If the engine does not support strict mode, this string will simply be ignored.</p>
                    <p>function strictly(){
                        'use strict';
                        }. Using strict mode within a function means it will only be applied to anything inside that
                        function</p>
                    <p>The recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function
                        like this:
                        (function(){'use strict'; //code for function}())

                        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
                        <p>JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint are all examples of linting tools</p>
                        <p>Linting tools can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code beyong simply using strict
                            mode.
                            They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors.</p>
                        <p>Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide, particularly when when
                            working in a team</p>


                        <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
                        <h3>The Trusty Alert</h3>
                        <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at aa certain
                            point in the code.</p>
                        <p>alert() strops the programm from running until OK is clicked, allowing us to effectively put
                            breakpoints in the code that let us chec
                            the value of variables at that point to see if they're what we expect them to be (use of
                            alert is discouraged for debugging purposes today)</p>

                        <h3>Using the Console</h3>
                        <p>console.log() - can be used to log the vale of variables at different stages of the program--
                            does not stop the execution of the program like alert()</p>
                        <p>function amIOldEnough(age){
                            console.log(age);
                            if (age < 12) { console.log(`In the if with ${age}`); return 'No, sorry.' ; } else if (age <
                                18) { console.log(`In the else-if with ${age}`);
                                return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.' ; } else { console.log(`In the else
                                with ${age}`); return 'Yep, come on in!' ; } }</p> <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>

                                    <p>Debugger keyword is the most useful commands for debugging. It creates a
                                        breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code
                                        and allow you to see where the program is currently up to</p>


                                    <h2>Error Objects</h2>
                                    <p>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs,
                                        or it can be created in the code using a constructor function like so:
                                        const error = new Error();</p>
                                    <p>This constructor function takes a parameter that's used as the error message:
                                        const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>

                                    <p>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only
                                        retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when
                                        using the global eval() function.</p>
                                    <p>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</p>
                                    <p>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t
                                        exist. For example, calling a function that hasn’t been defined.</p>
                                    <p>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</p>
                                    <p>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for
                                        example, a string is used when a number is expected.</p>
                                    <p>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</p>
                                    <p>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in
                                        the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this is too much recursion.</p>


                                    <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
                                    <h3>try, catch, and finally</h3>

                                    <p>If we suspect that a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in
                                        a <strong>try</strong> block.
                                                This will run the code insie the block as normal, but if an exception
                                                occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown
                                                onto a catch block</p>
                                    <p>Example: This code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown
                                        inside the try block. The error object
                                        is automatically passed as a parameter to the catch block allowing us to query
                                        the error name, message and stack properties</p>
                                    <p>function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
                                        'use strict';
                                        try {
                                        return String(squareRoot(number));
                                        } catch(error) {
                                        return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
                                        }
                                        }
                                        imaginarySquareRoot(-49) // notice that there's no error message shown
                                        << '7i' </p> 
                                    <p> A <strong>finally</strong> block can be added after a catch
                                        block. This will always be executed after the try or catch block
                                        regardless of whether an exception occured or not</p>
