            <h2>Functions Properties and Methods</h2>
                <a href="week4Notes.txt">Recap on functions</a>
            
            <h3>Call and Apply Methods</h3>
            <p>call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument</p>
            <p>Example: We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call() method
                to invoke the sayHello() function.

                const clark = {name:'Clarke'};
                const bruce = {name: 'Bruce'};

                sayHello.call(clark);
                result: 'Hello, my name is Clarke'
            </p>
            <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h3>
            <p>An immediately Invoked Function Expressions("iffy) is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon
                as it is defined
                (function(){
                    const temp = 'World';
                    console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
                    })();
                    'Hello World'
            </p>
            <h3>Functions that Define and Rewrite themselves</h3>
            <p>How? : Assign an aonymous function to a variable that has <strong>the same name as the function</strong>
            Consider the ff:
            function party(){
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
                }
                }
            This logs a message in the console, then redefines itself to log a different message in the console</p>
            <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
            <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met 
               <ul>
                   <li>Useful whn iterative processes are involved</li>
                   <li>Example:function factorial(n) {
                    if (n === 0) {
                    return 1;
                    } else {
                    return n * factorial(n - 1);
                    }
                    } </li>
                    <li>The function above will return 1 if 0 is provided as an argument(0 factorial is 1)
                        otherwise it will multiply the argument by the result of invoking itself with argument of one less. 
                    </li>
                    <li>The function will continue until 0 and 1 is returned</li>
               </ul> 
            </p>
            <h3>Callbacks</h3>
            <a href="week4/index.html">See chapter 4</a>
            <p>Callbacks can be used to to facilate event-driven asychronous programming</p>
            <p>This means  only peice of cOde will ever be processed at a time.The code run asychronously</p>
            <p>Using callbacks ensure that waiting for a task to complete doesn't hold up the execution of othr parts of the program.
                setTimeout() function can be used to callback after a given number of seconds.
            </p>
            <p>Callback Hell: more and more callbacks are used in the same function.</p>

            <h3>Promises</h3>
            <p>A promise represents the future results of an asynchronous operation</p>
