CHAPTER 2: POGRAMMING BASICS

The importance of a well commented code

Comments makes it easier for anybody reading your code to understand what's
going on.
Makes it easy for the programmer to come back to the code after weeks.

Two types of comments in JS: 
Single line comments starting with //
	//this is a short comment
Multi-line comments starting /* and finishing with */
	/*This is a long comments
	that can take mutliple lines
	and will still be ignored.*/

JS Grammar
A Javascript statement ends with a new line or semicolon
 	const message = 'Hello World!'
	alert(message)

OR
	const message = 'Hello World!';alert(message);

Primitive Data Types
String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null

Any value that isn't one of the primitive data types listed above is an OBJECT

type the operator typeof to check the data types, e.g typeof 'hello' will return string


Variables
Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.

Declaring and Assigning Variables
When to use const and when to use let?

const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value
let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.

examples:
	const name = 'Alexa';  //this won't be assigned to another string
	let score = 0;  	// this value may change during the program


Scope
Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their 
value only exists inside the block they are declared in.

There are two common scopes used : Global Scope and Local Scope

Global Scope
Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope.
This means it is accessible everywhere in the program.

Local Scope

Any variables defined inside a block using the let or const wwill only be available
inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.


Template Literals

These are special types of string. Template literals use the backtick `character to
deliminate the string
	example: `hello`;
This has the advantage of being able to use both types of quote marks
within the string like this
				`She said, "It's Me!"`


They also allow interpolation of JS code, meaning a js expression can be inserted inside
a string and the result will be displayed
		const name = `Siri`;
		`Hello ${ name }!`;
		result will display 'Hello Siri'


Assignment Operators:
points -= 5; // decreases points by 5
<< 15
points *= 2; // doubles points
<< 30
points /= 3; // divides value of points by 3
<< 10
points %= 7; // changes the value of points to the remainder
if its current value is divided by 7
<< 3

Converting between strings and Numbers

Strings to Number: Number('23') <<23

Numbers to Strings: String(3) <<'3'


Parsing Numbers

parseInt() -- can be used to convert a string representation of a numeral value back into a 
number.
